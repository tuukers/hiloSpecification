# Project Title: 
  HiLo
  
# Project Description:
  This project is a rendition of the classic high low game. The key difference is that instead of just using numbers,
  the numbers are represented as cards. The player guesses whether the number of the next card drawn will be higher or lower than
  the current one.

# Project Structure
  Our project contains two classes besides the program.cs class— Director.cs and Deck.cs. The director class contains
  game-running functions such as DisplayBoard(), GetGuess(), CheckGuess(), etc. The deck class contains all information
  pertaining to the deck of 13 cards and has the method DrawCard() which draws a random card each turn.
